# To-Do List

This is my first attempt at building anything in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)! This app is a to-do list, and should allow you to add to-do items to a list, indicate when you've completed a task, remove completed to-dos from your list, and clear the list entirely. This project was built on a template that "should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite."

## Recommended IDE Setup (according to template)

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Customize configurations

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).
